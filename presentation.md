# FactRadar Presentation

## Introduction

FactRadar is an advanced AI-powered application designed to detect fake news and misinformation in text content. This presentation outlines the key features, technology stack, and future development plans.

## Problem Statement

- Misinformation spreads 6x faster than factual content online
- 59% of people admit to sharing news without verifying its accuracy
- Traditional fact-checking is time-consuming and resource-intensive
- Need for automated, real-time verification tools

## Our Solution: FactRadar

FactRadar leverages multiple AI models to analyze and verify text content instantly, providing users with reliable information about the authenticity of news articles and social media posts.

## Key Features

### Multiple AI Models
- **Gradient Boosting**: Traditional ML model with high accuracy on structured features
- **LSTM**: Deep learning model good at capturing sequential patterns
- **CNN**: Deep learning model effective at capturing local patterns

### AI Cross-Verification
- Uses OpenRouter Mistral AI for additional verification
- Provides detailed reasoning for verification results
- Combines multiple AI opinions for higher accuracy

### User-Friendly Interface
- Clean, modern design with glass-morphism elements
- Real-time analysis with confidence scores
- Intuitive model selection

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Hooks for state management

### Backend
- Flask (Python) for API endpoints
- TensorFlow for deep learning models
- Scikit-learn for traditional ML models

### AI Integration
